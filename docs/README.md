# Introduction

`TabulatedData` plugin reusable data table component that converts raw (JSON) data into HTML table format with ease and flexibility. And it should be able to work with any CSS framework because of the HTML table generated.

Fields definition is a unique feature in `TabulatedData` that allows you to define which fields to be used and manipulated before displaying.

You begin by defining data fields for your JSON data structure that you want to present in HTML table. Then, progressively configuring it to display the data the way you want.

Ultimately, you can use it to create a wrapper component to contain the UI/UX of your own datatable component in one place to achieve consistant look and feel.
